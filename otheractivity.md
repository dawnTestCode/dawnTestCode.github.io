What's on my mind these days?
--------------------------------

I thought it might be a fun idea to do something a little bit different.  I'd like to keep a page that describes the things that are on my mind lately, in bigger format than Twitter, but not quite big enough or formed enough to write a full blog post about.

* Mutation testing

  Does this require a certain level of team or process maturity?

* Testing cognitive computing/machine learning

  How does the Watson team test?

* Mobile testing/ emulators

* Testers as SME

* Startups and testing expertise
