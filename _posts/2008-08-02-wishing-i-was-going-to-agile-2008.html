I am most definitely wishing I was going to Agile 2008.  I have seen on the Yahoo groups and on the web page that there will be many people there that I would love to listen to and learn from.  I saw that someone is posting constant updates from there and I will certainly be following that.<br /><br /><a href="http://friendfeed.com/rooms/agile-2008">http://friendfeed.com/rooms/agile-2008</a><br /><br />I'll be watching the Twitterers as well.  To the people I know who are going, I'll be there in spirit!
