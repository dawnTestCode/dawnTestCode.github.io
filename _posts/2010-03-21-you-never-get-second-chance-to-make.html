I absolutely have to blog about this.  For most people who attended Agile Coach Camp in Durham, NC this weekend, you are likely already somewhat familiar with this story, but I think there is a *really* valuable lesson worth sharing here.<div><br /></div><div>I'm going to tell a story.  When I have permission (assuming  I get it), I will reveal the identity of the person in the story.  I want to, if he'll let me, because I would like to be able to publicize what he's doing in the future.</div><div><br /></div><div>At a conference last year, I had the opportunity to attend a TDD clinic. We were pairing in this clinic, and I ended up with two partners: someone I had never met or heard of -- let's call him Joe -- and someone I had really been wanting to meet -- let's call her Sarah.  I found myself in a triangular-shaped pair, one of three very strong-willed people.</div><div><br /></div><div>The experience was not a good one, for anyone involved.  I'm not a developer anymore in my day job, and I only felt like I had so much authority.  Both of my partners were developers, and I quickly found that Sarah and I had very similar ideas of what pairing should be like, but that was *very* different than how Joe paired.  Sarah and I felt like our opinions were not being heard, and that Joe was trying very strongly to dictate to us exactly what should be done, down to exactly what words I should type.  I can say that at one point, sitting in the middle of the two of them, I literally had Joe say "Type this" and Sarah say "No! Don't type that!"</div><div><br /></div><div>Hopefully, I have gotten across that this was not a positive experience for any of the 3 of us.  During a break, Sarah and I managed to find a friend -- let's call her Kathy -- and she agreed to come into the session and work with Joe, so that Sarah and I could work together in a way that was more comfortable for us.  Certainly, this felt like the cowardly way of (not) dealing with the issue, and part of me wanted to address it directly, but I didn't get there.</div><div><br /></div><div>In all honesty, I have not thought terribly much about this situation since that conference.  I told the story to a few people at the conference, but not since.  I had simply marked Joe off as someone I had a personality conflict with and would not want to work with.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, why would I tell you today that Joe is now literally in my top 10 list of my absolutely favorite people?  If given the opportunity, I will work with him in a heartbeat.</div><div><br /></div><div>I believe that this example shows the power of an open mind, and the power of not judging people based on a single experience (obviously, this applies in both directions).</div><div><br /></div><div>I arrived at Agile Coach Camp Friday night, registered, and made my rounds.  Headed over to the bar, and who do I see?  Well, there is Joe.  At some point, I had seen his name on the roster and thought "this should be interesting, but I should be able to just avoid him".  I don't think we were a whole 5 minutes into hanging out when the topic of our experience at the conference last year got brought up- by him.  He set the tone flawlessly, by indicating that he knew me through a negative experience that had been traumatic, though largely his fault.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let me just say, I really don't care to point fingers at or lay blame on anyone, so I do actually tend to struggle with someone who has just pointed a finger at themself.</div><div><br /></div><div>He then put the ball in my court to describe the situation.  I tried, as best I could to describe what had happened in a fairly diplomatic way, saying that we were in a situation where our different styles of pairing conflicted with each other.  I did take my description a step farther, however, and described for the table how he had dictated to me exactly what to type.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, here it was, this elephant was on the table, had been exposed, laid out bare.  I was *incredibly* impressed with his humility.  It really contradicted the arrogance I had seen in him last year.  I appreciated that we both got to laugh about the experience.  I learned a side that I had not known as well.  I heard about how traumatic it had been for him (which also contradicts the arrogance I had seen), and the circumstances he was in at that time.  I heard the stories that others had told him of what I had said.  Honestly, I had no considered that it had upset him; he had seemed pretty oblivious to it at the time.</div><div><br /></div><div>So I spent Friday, Saturday, and Sunday with an open mind.  I watched him and interacted with him as if I had met him for the first time this weekend.  The more I saw, the more I not only gained respect for him, but wanted to talk to him and share and learn from him.</div><div><br /></div><div>I saw a person who is clearly fantastically passionate about what he is doing -- coding, refactoring, or teaching.  I saw someone who has a wealth of knowledge to share, so much so that at times, you can almost watch it bubbling out of his ears.  I saw someone who really *does* know what he is doing, inside, outside, and around.  I got a taste of just how much I could learn, and just how parallel my passion and recent path is to many of the things that he has been doing as well.  I bounced ideas off him for ways I can contribute to my community, and learned through discussions with him that things I thought I knew, I don't.  He is aware of and describes his own weaknesses without hesitation.  </div><div><br /></div><div>In closing circle (this was an Open Space conference), we each talked about our experience at the camp.  I sat in my seat, ready to describe the transformational experience to the group (by that point, a few people had heard the story).  I was proud of myself for keeping an open mind and not letting the first experience cloud my view of him through the weekend.  I was grateful that he did the same with me and was open to addressing the experience directly and had also been open to not judging me.  I was grateful that I had not missed out on the opportunity to connect with another person in software who is clearly passionate, smart, and has a lot to offer. As I waited for my turn, he got up to tell the group about his experience this weekend.</div><div><br /></div><div>Whaddya know, he told this whole story, in much the same way I have now.  He said, "They say you never get a chance to make a first impression.  Well, maybe sometimes, you do."</div><div><br /></div><div>Joe, I look forward to working with you in the future and contributing to this community as a team.</div>
