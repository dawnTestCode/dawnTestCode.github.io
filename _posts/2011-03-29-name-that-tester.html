No, no, no, not "name that  tester", like the old game show where you have to identify an object or person based a series of clues ...<br /><br />I mean, NAME that tester.<br /><br />Here's what I mean in less ambiguous terms.  I have the opportunity to change my name.  On April 1, 2011, I will participate in a life changing event that will allow me to change my name.  Typically, this event causes a young woman to take the name of a young man ... okay, I won't insult your intelligence.  I'm getting married.<br /><br />But neither I nor my soon-to-be-husband is particularly tied to our family name.  Him less than me, so we don't want his last name.  What this means is that we can change our last name to anything we want.<br /><br />Whoa, wait a minute, anything we want?  Yep, that's right.  Absolutely anything we want.<br /><br />We're stuck, though.  The kids are less than helpful.  His 4 year old daughter votes to change her middle name to Hacker and her last name to Johnson.  My son is in favor of our current last name, or the name Love.<br /><br />Personally, I want something clever -- with hidden meaning.  I'd LOVE LOVE LOVE it if I could find a way to fit the letters t-e-s-t into it, because let's face it, I'm a tester for life, and I am proud of that fact :)<br /><br />If I have my way, my middle name will be NinjaMonkey.<br /><br />So, here I am reaching out to my clever, geeky, techie community, and asking for name suggestions.  I want to hear them all -- what would you change your last name to if you could?
