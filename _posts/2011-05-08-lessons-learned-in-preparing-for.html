Last year at Agile 2010, <a href="http://www.thehackerchickblog.com/">Abby Fichtner</a> and I did a technical half-day tutorial involving FitNesse and some code.  We first presented a few examples together, and then intended to walk the audience through a series of stories themselves.  We ran into common issues:<br /><ul><li>We gave the attendees usb sticks and CDs at the beginning of the tutorial, and many of them were distracted and not listening while we gave our introductory information</li><li>I would estimate that 40% of the people had issues with installing and starting the software (Java, Eclipse, FitNesse).  After spending WAY TOO LONG trying to get everyone up and running (I saw some errors I had NEVER seen before!), there were still a significant number of people unable to run successfully</li><li>I believe we had some assumptions/expectations about the attendees -- things they would be able to do already (like use Eclipse), that many of them struggled with.</li></ul><br />So this year, when I was going to give a half-day tutorial at STAREast on using FitNesse and Selenium, I spent a lot of time beforehand making sure that I could avoid some of these pitfalls. In the end, the tutorial went as smoothly as I could have asked, so I thought I would share what I considered, learned, and ended up with.<br /><br />My final environment, delivered on USB sticks that I gave to each attendee (I got lucky with all computers that had USB ports in the room!), had the following on it:<br /><ul><li>An installer for VirtualBox for windows</li><li>An installer for VirtualBox for mac</li><li>An Ubuntu virtual machine, outfitted with the following:</li><ul><li>The download from the <a href="https://github.com/marisaseal/selenesse">SeleNesse web site</a>, which includes:</li><ul><li>FitNesse</li><li>SeleNesse library</li><li>I added the Selenium Server from Selenium 2.0b4</li></ul><li>A double-clickable shell script that did the following:</li><ul><li>Started FitNesse on port 8080</li><li>Started the Selenium Server</li><li>Opened firefox, to http://localhost:8080</li></ul><li>Inside the FitNesse directory was a page called HtmlElements. The origin/idea came from the original SeleNesse download, which I credited to <a href="http://thetestingblog.com/author/marrrisa/">Marisa Seal</a>, who credited it to <a href="http://gojko.net/">Gojko Adzic</a> (Thanks, Gojko!).  This page gave me a website to test against, since there was no internet connection. (See Lesson 0 - what to test)</li></ul></ul><br />To get them up and running, they had to do the following:<br /><ul><li>Install VirtualBox (which could be done from the USB stick directly (See Lesson 1 - admin rights))</li><li>Copy a folder called SE2011 from the USB stick to their computer, to a location they could find (See Lesson 2 - running from usb is SLOW)</li><li>Either double-click the SE2011.vbox file in the local SE2011 folder, or go into VirtualBox and click Machine-&gt;Add and add the SE2011.vbox file.</li><li>Select the SE2011 VM and click Start</li></ul><br />Once they were in the VM, they had to open the SE2011 folder and double-click on the StartTutorial.sh file, then click the Run button.<br /><br />I saw 2 hiccups during this session that I wasn't expecting:<br /><ul><li>On Windows XP (I had tested on Win7), installing VirtualBox threw up a warning involving security of virtual interfaces.  Allowing the install anyway did not prove to be problematic for the 2 people who had this issue.</li><li>1 person's VirtualBox didn't have a Machine-&gt;Add menu.  Not sure if they had the same version or a previous one, but we worked around it.</li></ul><br />So, how did I get there?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Lesson 0 - what to test</span><br />I knew going into this tutorial that there would not be internet access in the tutorial room, and that I was going to have to provide something to test that could be run locally.  Last year, when I did a non-interactive talk on the same subject, I was running a local Windows website that I had installed into IIS previous to speaking.  This time, I didn't want the extra step of having a website that had to be installed and started locally in order to test it, especially since the things we could fit into a tutorial would be pretty simple.<br /><br />Being able to add HTML elements to a local FitNesse site was convenient for a variety of reasons:<br /><ul><li>It avoided another piece of possible setup/configuration complexity</li><li>It gave me an easy-to-edit controlled environment to add simple examples to test</li><li>The learning curve for what was on the site was minimized</li></ul><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">How I came to choose this environment</span><br />The first thing that was suggested to me for minimizing set up and configuration issues at a tutorial was a bootable USB stick.  There are several resources out there for creating bootable USB sticks with Ubuntu (whatever) edition on them, and NetBook edition was suggested to me.<br /><br />I tried for many long hours to make this work, and used at least three different methods for creating this bootable USB stick.  Not one of them would boot from *my own* macbook pro.  If I couldn't get it to work at home, I couldn't have any confidence in it at a tutorial.  Even then, I still had lingering questions about being able to save a machine state and allow them to boot into the usb and then have the ingredients I needed them to have, and I had questions about speed.<br /><br />After burning 10-15 unsuccessful hours on this bootable stick idea, I decided I would shoot for a Virtual Machine, with some kind of client player for them.  I looked at VMWare, which I happen to enjoy.  The VMWare Player is free for Windows, but VMWare Fusion for Mac is a paid-for application.  Buying licenses for each USB stick wasn't an option, so I looked at VirtualBox.  I was able to read that I could use VirtualBox for both Windows and OSX platforms and put the installers onto the USB drives. (Given that information, I decided that someone coming in with a Linux-only laptop was an edge case that I wasn't going to support.)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Lesson 1 - admin rights</span><br />In testing the VirtualBox installer on a few different platforms as users with a few different rights, I found the following: In general, users with "standard privileges" (both Mac and Windows 7) could not install VirtualBox.  It appeared that anyone who could generally install applications could install VirtualBox, and I decided that this was another edge case I was not going to support.<br /><br /><i>(side note:  I suspected that some people would not arrive with computers as well.  That makes 3 edge cases I've counted so far that would prevent successful hands-on learning.  Knowing that edge cases where people would be unable to get this configuration up and going would exist, I decided early that in those few cases, I would just ask that they go and pair with someone who had a laptop with them that was able to get running successfully.  My goal was not to waste time working through configuration issues.  Also, since each attendee was getting a USB stick with the whole set up, I felt confident that even those without laptops weren't missing anything.)<br /></i><br />Once I had decided on that environment, I took to creating the VM I wanted with each piece of what was needed to run Selenium through FitNesse.  Each step along the way, I tested what I had on a few different computers -- a macbook pro, a Windows7 desktop machine and a Netbook (least powerful of the three).  After only a few tries, I came quickly to ...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Lesson 2 - running from usb is SLOW</span><br />This was most evident on the Netbook, but each time we ran a version of the VM while the VM was living on the USB stick, it was dog slow!  On the Netbook, it was basically unusable, and that was unacceptable.  When I got frustrated enough, I decided that I was going to make sure that each attendee copied the VM to their local machine.  Adding this step was negligibly more risky, but the benefit far outweighed that risk.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">In some ways, I got lucky</span><br />With only 20 people at my tutorial, the risk of edge cases was minimized.  It was a wonderful group, though, and the size was really great for being able to address individual needs while still guiding the whole group.  I did not run into any of the technical edge cases I was worried about (Linux, or non-admin users), though there were a few people without laptops.  Working in pairs seemed to be okay for those people, as far as I could tell.<br /><br />I feel grateful for how smoothly my tutorial went, given how much trouble I have heard about from other presenters over the past couple of years.  I loved the group that came to visit, and we had a blast!
