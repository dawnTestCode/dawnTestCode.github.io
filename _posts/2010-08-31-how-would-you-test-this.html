So, I am using Google Voice as my voicemail these days. It's neat, and I like it, mostly. They offer, for free, a transcription service that sends me an email/txt message of what the caller said. Over the last 3 days, I've gotten calls form my son's middle school about him being absent (he is actually withdrawn!).<div><br /></div><div>The beauty of this setup is that the tester in me LOVES certain characteristics of this test set.  The call is an automated one -- in this case, I know that the caller is saying the *same exact* thing every time.  The tone is the same, the inflections are the same, it's the same voice source data.  However, over 3 days, I've gotten 3 different transcriptions from Google Voice!<br /><br />The voice mail *actually* says this:<br />Hello. This is the attendance office at Durant Road Middle school, calling to inform you that your child, Steven Cannan, was marked absent today. Please send a signed note upon returning to school, explaining the reason for the absence. Thank you.<br /><br />And following are THREE Google Voice transcriptions ... they crack me UP!<br /><br />Day 1:<br />Hello, this is the attendance office ed to Ron corrode middle school calling to inform you that your child. Hey, it's Dawn Cannan was marked absent today. Please send a signed note on returning to school, explaining the reason for the absence. Thank you.<br /><br /><br />Day 2:<br />Hello, this is the attendance office and to Ron corrode middle school calling to inform you that your child. Jeanne cannon. You're a smart ass in today. Please send a signed note up on returning to school, explaining the reason for the absence. Thank you.<br /><br /><br />Day 3:<br />Hello, this is the attendance office at Deron corrode middle school calling to inform you that your child G intended You're a smart ass IN today. Please send a signed note up. I'm returning to school, explaining the reason for the absence. Thank you.<br /><br />I *kind of* think they did the best job on the first day :)  </div><div><br /></div><div>But this brings up an interesting point for me, and it's one that I have encountered several times in my career as a tester.</div><div><br /></div><div>Roughly, I can ask this question as something like this:  How can you test something that is not feasible to prove, logically or mathematically, is *correct* every time?  </div><div><br /></div><div>I can think of so many examples where testing isn't cut and dry.  I started working as a tester in a company that did software that processed genetics algorithms.  How did we know that the genetics algorithms were correct?  At that time, I started off by having all of my testers know how to do the algorithms by hand, so that results that weren't right would just stick out to them.</div><div><br /></div><div>At one point, I was testing a search engine.  I was lucky in this case to have knowledge of the source data in a database.  One approach I took here was to find objects in the source data that exhibited certain special (and easy to identify) characteristics.  Then, I could perform searches that I *knew* would return those objects and look for them early in the test results.  But even then, I didn't really know that the search engine was performing correctly.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recently, I read a set of slides by Harry Robinson, talking about testing Google Maps.  Here's another good example:  How do you test something that has multiple right answers, in such a way that you feel confident releasing it to customers?</div><div><br /></div><div>I've given two approaches that I have used, but I'd like to know how others have solved similar issues.  Please, let's talk, I'd love to hear more from you.</div>
