<span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">So, this next one, for me, points out something that I felt was a difficulty in being a tester with development experience.<br /><br />I don't believe I handled it the best way, but hope that I can use it as an example and teach, perhaps, better ways to deal with developers.<br /><br />Not long after I started, we were developing a way to download data from our website to a file.  The requirements said that the file name had to be alphanumeric, with spaces allowed.  This seems easy enough to test, right?  So, in the file name field, I held down my shift key and I went all over the keyboard:<br /><br />~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+|}{":?/.,';\][=-`<br /><br />As I expected, I broke the site.  Broke it in a bad way, like big exception on the screen.  Wowee ... I filed a bug.  It got worked on, and I repeated my steps in the file name field.<br /><br />~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+|}{":?/.,';\][=-`<br /><br />AHA!  The SAME THING HAPPENED!  Incredulous, I walked over to the developer's desk, sat down, and talked about the issue with him.  He pulled up the source code.  I couldn't believe what I saw.  It looked something like this (pseudo-code):<br /><br />for (each char in filename field) {<br />if (char == !) {<br />  pop message up to the user about invalid chars;<br /></span></span><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">  if (char == @) {<br />  pop message up to the user about invalid chars;<br /></span></span><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">  if (char == #) {<br />  pop message up to the user about invalid chars;<br /></span></span><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">  if (char == $) {<br />  pop message up to the user about invalid chars;<br /></span></span><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">  if (char == %) {<br />  pop message up to the user about invalid chars;<br /></span></span><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">  if (char == ^) {<br />  pop message up to the user about invalid chars;<br /></span></span><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">  if (char == &amp;) {<br />  pop message up to the user about invalid chars;<br /><br />and so on .....<br /><br />*GASP*  I absolutely could not believe what I saw.  CS 102 taught me better than that.  So I said to him "Why are you doing it that way?  Can't you use something like a regular expression?"  He said something like "Oh, well, Java doesn't have regular expressions."  Me:  "Um, yes it does.  I have used them.  In Java."  Him: "Well, I don't know how to use them, so this will work for now."<br /><br />Huh?  Angry that he had tried to pull a fast one on me, absolutely shocked that it was being done how it was being done, I left the conversation.  I ended up talking to a few other people, informally, about my concern, but nothing happened immediately.  Of course, he found out I had complained about him (I don't suppose I expressed it in the nicest way), and once again, I had created a dev vs. QA situation.<br /><br />Eventually, I worked out the relationship with said developer, and made it a friendly one again.  That code was never released.<br /><br />As I thought about it later ... I realized that I *did* know how to do what needed to be done, but I let his strictly "tester" view of me prevent me from trying to teach him how to be a better developer.  In hindsight, when the conversation hit the "Well, I don't know how to do it" point, I should have been able to say, "Okay, let's work through this together and let me show you.  Let's find the regex class ..." etc.  I have found since then that our developers are generally pretty open to sitting down together with me and letting me show them a way to do something that I have used before.<br /><br />Laughing at myself yet again ... in a more true to agile way, the team works much better when testers and developers can just sit together for a while, and non-confrontationally (I don't think that's a word, but it's a quality I strive for) discuss the pros and cons of using certain strategies for solving problems.  I have seen many problems solved really early when I pair program/test with a developer as they code, when I can ask the questions and point out the things that I know will come up in my testing.  It just makes sense.<br /></span></span>
