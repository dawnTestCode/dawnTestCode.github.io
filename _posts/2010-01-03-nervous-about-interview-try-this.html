I think for most of us, being on the interviewee side of an interview is *hard*.  Personally, I am always really nervous when I feel like I am being judged.  I don't like being the center of attention.  I have trouble with public speaking for these same reasons.  An interview is a judgement of my professional abilities, and to not be offered a position after an interview is a *rejection* that hits a nerve.  It's enough to make anybody nervous.<div><br /></div><div>In public speaking, many people have little tips and tricks to help with being nervous.  They may tell you to picture everyone naked (does anyone actually *do* that??), or to focus on a single person, make eye contact, and pretend like you are speaking only to them.</div><div><br /></div><div>For interviewing, I found a way of looking at the interview that seemed to really help alleviate my nervousness before and during an interview:  I pretended like I was just chatting with someone I had met at a conference.</div><div><br /></div><div>I went to Agile 2009 in August, and I met a great many people that were in all kinds of different positions.  Some were testers, some were developers, some were coaches, some were <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Ux</span> experts.  Some were consultants, some worked for very large companies, some very small.  The range of experiences and situations was pretty big.  I found that conversations were easy to get into with every single person I met.  I'd ask a bit about where they worked and what they did, and what they were hoping to get out of the conference.  I'd tell them a bit about me and what I was hoping to get out of the conference, too.</div><div><br /></div><div>Sometimes someone would say something about an issue they were trying to solve that I had experience with, and I would be able to share some of my experience with them.  Of course, this was a two way street, and I got a lot of great advice too.  The point is that I did this enough times that in just a few short days it became pretty natural.  If you've been to a large professional gathering, I'd guess that you've done much of the same thing.</div><div><br /></div><div>So the next time I found myself on the interviewee side of the table, I told myself that I was just talking to another person I had met at a conference.  I think that this idea addresses two main points of an interview: it helps me to learn about the company I am interviewing for (after all, an interview *is* (or should be) two-sided), *and* it helps them to get insight into what *I* can do for their team should they hire me.</div><div><br /></div><div>When I ask them about what they do, I learn some more than just a job description provides about the company, the team, and the role.  I can ask specific questions, like what a day in the life of this role looks like.  When I ask them about their biggest pain points, I get insight into where their weaknesses are, and whether I think these are things I want to deal with or tackle.</div><div><br /></div><div>Asking about biggest pain points is doubly beneficial, though, because then I can also look for things I can relate to.  I look for things similar to what I have experienced in the past.  When I find them, I can then discuss my own similar experience and what happened in that situation.  In doing that, I provide the interviewer with information about how I can help them, how their hiring me will benefit them and make me the best candidate for the position.</div><div><br /></div><div>Is it possible that I won't find anything I can relate to?  I suppose, but I don't think it's all that frequent.  If it happens, it may mean that I'm not a good fit for that position anyway.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also think that to whatever degree I can pull this attitude off, it takes some of the pressure off of me too.  I learned many years ago that I interviewed the best when I didn't really *need* the job, likely because I wasn't paralyzed with terror for my job status.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, take a deep breath, relax, and just chat.  Your passion and expertise will come out naturally. :)</div>
