A little under a year ago, I posted slides and downloads for Executable Specs using FitNesse/Selenium (aka SeleNesse).<div><br /></div><div>This year, I am in a spot to teach others how to do this technique hands-on, and I am pretty excited about it.  SQE has given me the opportunity to conduct a half-day tutorial at STAREast: 3.5 blissful hours of getting in front of a computer, learning just how easy it is to start writing acceptance criteria and tests as a team, in the same place where the tests will eventually be executed.</div><div><br /></div><div>Check out the program for STAREast this year here:  <a href="http://www.sqe.com/StarEast/Schedule/Default.aspx">http://www.sqe.com/StarEast/Schedule/Default.aspx</a></div><div><br /></div><div>To read the abstract for my tutorial, check out this page and scroll down a bit: <a href="http://www.sqe.com/StarEast/Tutorials/Default.aspx?Day=Tuesday">http://www.sqe.com/StarEast/Tutorials/Default.aspx?Day=Tuesday</a></div><div><br /></div><div>If you can make it to STAREast this year, I have a discount code for an extra $200 off.  Just use <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; ">SKWS</span> when you check out to receive the discount.</div>
