I've recently decided to dive into the world of Project White and MS UI Automation, since this is relevant to my current project.  I had to create a tutorial for a team to get set up to use white to begin with, so I decided that I could share that tutorial with everyone else as well.  It goes into some detail about Visual Studio as well, and is intended for an audience that has not necessarily done automated testing through Visual Studio before.<br /><br />The tutorial uses MS Visual Studio, C#, White, and UI Spy to create an *extremely* simple test.  My intent was just to show how to set it up.  Next time, I will describe starting to write tests, including common functions in White and writing good tests.<br /><br />Please, please offer feedback.  I would love to be sure that I am doing things the best way possible!<br /><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B5opZyB3tUYZYjYxMTc5NzgtNmM2Mi00Y2MzLThjMWItY2Q0NTE2OTdjNmJj&amp;hl=en">White Tutorial</a>
