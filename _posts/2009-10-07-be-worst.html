Huh?  Did I just say "be the worst"?  Yep, I sure did.  But before you go telling your boss that I told you to be the worst tester you can be, let me finish the phrase!<br /><br />First and foremost, I have to give credit where credit is due.  I saw this phrase first from Chris McMahon -- he says that this meme has been around the music business for a long time.  He credits <a href="http://hepcat1950.com/pmivmix1.html">Pat Metheny</a>, who said, "...try to be the worst guy in whatever band you're in.  That's the secret."<br /><br />Given the context, what I am saying is "be the worst of the people you are surrounded by", or "surround yourself with really great people."<br /><br />At Agile 2009, someone told me that <a href="http://testobsessed.com/">Elisabeth Hendrickson</a> decided to learn by inserting herself into the best teams she could find.  Even before I encountered the "be the worst" quote, I had begun bouncing around the idea of how I perceive myself versus those I work with.<br /><br />I think back to an early job in my career, straight out of college.  At this place, I remember thinking to myself with some frequency, "These people are *SO* *SMART*!  I feel SO DUMB when I am around them!"  I often tried to just keep up with conversation, hoping to fake it long enough to avoid appearing dumb, too!  Looking back, how I wish I could have gotten over my own insecurity and taken the opportunity for exactly the opportunity it was!  What I should have been thinking was "Wow, these people are *SO* *SMART*! I want to learn everything I *can* from them!"<br /><br />What can we get out of "being the worst", and why would anyone suggest that?<br /><br />I think we can get a *lot* out of it: learning, experience, growth ... In working with people who have a set of skills that you wish to expand for yourself, you can see first-hand, on a day-to-day basis, and under a whole slew of circumstances how that quality is manifested.  Sometimes it might be a technical skill.  Maybe it's a communication skill.<br /><br />As I have grown in my career, I have begun to feel like the "dumb one" less and less.  I think that my passion to get better and better at the things I want to be good at, have made it more and more difficult for me to *be the worst*.  What have I done in response?<br /><br />I've become *way* more active in the agile community.  In that way, I can surround myself (though not as frequently as I would like) with those people I see as *way* more skilled than I am in certain things.  I found this out with certainty at Agile 2009.  I love talking to Elisabeth Hendrickson for her insight into agile testing and human relationships at work.  I enjoy Lisa Crispin's company for her amazing ability to be a great agile tester, without falling back on programming the hard things (like I do!).  I met Patrick Wilson-Welsh, and admired his passion, sense of humor, and ideas on good, clean TDD.  I had conversations with Michael Feathers and Bob Martin to try to gain some insight into my specific legacy code issues.  I had great conversations with Antony Marcano and Andy Palmer about testing tools and frameworks.  I *pair programmed* with Abby Fichtner to gain from her development experience.  Of course, there were many others ....<br /><br />In this way, I forged relationships and surrounded myself in a way that I could *be the worst*.  I'll keep saving my pennies to go to conferences and keep being active in the agile community so that I can keep *being the worst*.<br /><br />Do others try to put themselves into situations where they can *be the worst*?  How do you keep yourself always learning and always surrounded by those you can learn from?
