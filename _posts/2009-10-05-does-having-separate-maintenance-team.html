I was recently thinking about a situation that puzzled me, and came to a realization that makes me a bit nervous ....<br /><br />I have had exposure to some teams where even though they are in firefighting mode more often that is comfortable, and/or even though their customers are unhappy, and/or even though their software has a *lot* of bugs, they still don't seem to "get it" and try to do things in a better way.<br /><br />I have sat, baffled, looking at people who lead these teams, my jaw on the floor, wondering why the people leading these teams are passing the buck on the team's responsibility for problems, and instead presenting a magic show to prove why the problem is not theirs.<br /><br />And today, something hit me:  I was thinking about what would cause someone to change; what would make it so that they finally felt the need to do something different, and the term "the wall of pain" came to mind.  This term comes from a blog post I read a few months ago, "<a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2009/06/03/fighting-technical-debt-with-the-wall-of-pain.aspx">Fighting Technical Debt with the Wall of Pain</a>".  What would instigate change?  Enough pain that it feels necessary, in order to escape the pain.<br /><br />This reminds me of Parenting 101:  How do I stop my 12-year-old from making irresponsible decisions?  I make them painful enough that he will be sure to avoid the pain.  Luckily, these days that is as easy as "Oops! Your PSP ran away! I can't find it!", or "Where are your Playstation controllers?  Gee, I don't know ... I guess maybe they will return when you start doing the chores that you are responsible for."<br /><br />BUT ... BUT ... what about companies where the new development team is a separate entity from a maintenance team?  What if the developers who are writing new code are sheltered and protected from the results of poorly written code?  In some cases, it goes something like this:<br /><br />-  Development team writes software ... Maybe they fix a few bugs along the way.  Sometimes, if bugs come up and it can be proven that they existed in previously written code, they may shrug them off as not the result of current work, so not their problem right now.<br />-  Development team's schedule gets squished, and as it gets closer to release time, only the *most* important bugs that are proven to be the result of their current work, are even looked at by the team.<br />-  Release happens.  At this point, product is a released product, and the workflow now looks like this:<br />-  Customer has an issue, customer calls Support.  Support tries to reproduce it, and if they can, they file a bug.  Bug gets reported to Maintenance team, and they work on it.<br /><br />In the above scenario (which exists in some companies), the team that originally wrote the aforementioned poorly written code <span style="font-weight: bold;">never sees the wall of pain</span>.  Seriously, for the most part, there is absolutely zero repercussion to them directly for bad code.<br /><br />In a case like this, the responsibility for well-written code falls upon those who are internally motivated to do their best, and strong enough personalities that they fight the push to get *something* out *faster*, well-written or not.  I believe that this type of personality does not describe the majority, and the whole team falls into a pattern of continuing to write poorly written code.  What is there to stop them? <br /><br />Has anyone had any experience helping a team to transition into a more agile-like process from a situation that looked like this one?  How do companies like this adjust to fight this pattern?<br /><br />I wonder if it would help to break up the idea of "new dev" versus "maintenance" teams, and instead cross-pollinate into functional teams.  In this case, there would be a team for one specific module, component, or module, and they would handle both new work and bug fixing/maintenance.  Would this strategy work?
