No, not that *awful* movie with Nicholas Cage.<div><br /></div><div>Yesterday, I tweeted something general, though generalized from within a specific situational context for me.  The tweet said:</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(62, 68, 21); line-height: 16px; "><blockquote></blockquote></span></div><span><span><blockquote>Once again, knowing (good or bad) is so much better than not knowing.</blockquote></span></span><div><span><span>Pretty quickly, Jon Bach (@jbtestpilot) replied with the following:</span></span></div><div><span><span><blockquote>@dckismet Good blog idea. Now go blog it so I can disagree. :)</blockquote>Welllllll, ooooooookaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyy, but oh boy, what's coming?  I'm feeling a little like a ninja, making sure I prevent any attack before it can happen :)</span></span><div><font class="Apple-style-span" color="#3E4415" face="'Lucida Grande', sans-serif" size="4"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: georgia; line-height: 36px; font-size: 29px; "><blockquote></blockquote></span></span></font></div></div><div>In any case, what I eventually settled on was the fact that there must be a set of circumstances under which what I said holds true (this is the case I was making in my tweet), and a set of circumstances under which it does not hold true.  I hadn't been able to think of many obvious situations where I wouldn't have agreed with that statement, so I had tweeted it as the generalized statement I made.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let me just qualify for a minute how I feel about generalizations -- I'm not a terrible fan of them.  I usually am teased for the depth with which I qualify just about everything I say, especially in my professional life as a tester.  Unfortunately, the early part of my career involved jobs where I was asked if a release was ready to go and I said "Yes", only to have issues crop up and have my good name sullied in the wake of failure.  I learned quickly to say things like "Well, we are aware of x high priority issues and y lower priority issues.  Given what I know, I would be comfortable letting the customer have it."  In short, I generally don't generalize.  140 characters makes that difficult.</div><div><br /></div><div>Conveniently, I am not at liberty to divulge the exact situation that lead me to my tweet yesterday, but what I can do is describe what types of situations my statement fits for.  Certainly, I can think of examples where finally knowing something that was previously uncertain is "better" -- usually for me, "better" means that I can have enough certainty about the situation to be comfortable making decisions about moving forward.</div><div><br /></div><div>Generally speaking, I think that "knowing" (I'll just abbreviate the entire statement with that one word) is better when something is happening that impacts future activity.  I can think of a few examples:  If a company is going to be downsizing and people aren't sure who/when it will happen, if someone may have some illness or disease and is waiting on laboratory results, </div>
