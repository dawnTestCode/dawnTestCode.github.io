I can easily be described as "just one of the guys".  It's just how I am.  There is background that makes this natural for me.  And that's okay.  Somehow, though, I still seem to be able to manage being a girly girl, too.  I am not a brutish woman, I wear makeup, jewelry, and dresses whenever I can.  I am almost *always* in a pair of heels.<div><br /></div><div>At this point, this is easy for me, but I've come to realize that it may not seem quite so natural to other people, especially women.  So I thought I'd just chat about how it goes for me.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
