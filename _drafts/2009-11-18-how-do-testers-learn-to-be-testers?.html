Matt Heusser recently posted on his <a href="http://blogs.stpcollaborative.com/matt/2009/11/18/you-say-you-want-a-revolution/">STP Collaborative blog</a> a question about training for testers.  It's a completely valid question, and I'll be interested to see what the responses are.  I wonder, though, if the (obvious to me) need for testing training isn't the result of a lack of widespread formal training.
