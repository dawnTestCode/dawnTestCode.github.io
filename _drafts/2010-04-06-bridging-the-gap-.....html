Most of us have seen the classic cycle between business people and developers, right?  Business person asks for something, developer implements it, and business person is not happy.  Business person feels that the developer did not do as they asked, developer feels that business person is changing requirements or forcing "scope creep".  Attempts are made to resolve the delta, but before you know it, stuff is slinging and occasionally, some of it hits a fan.<div><br /></div><div>As a tester, I have often described my role as being somewhat of a liaison between these other roles.  Sometimes, it's like a monkey in the middle game, but sometimes, it works.  I do my best to speak the language of the developer *and* the business person, so that I can help translate between the two.  As a result, I have been intrigued for quite some time with being able to write test cases that can be read by business people -- or even better, executed by them as well.  Some call this executable specifications, and that makes us think of tools like Cucumber.  I hear other associated terms like BDD and DSLs, too.  I'm going to avoid as many of the buzzwords as I can for this post.</div>
