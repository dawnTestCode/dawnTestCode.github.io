<div>At Agile 2009, I have several great conversations about hiring, but not *just* hiring- hiring *great* testers. How do you hire great testers?<br /><br />It's *HARD*, for sure!<br /><br />I suppose that before I can even think about how to hire one, it would help to *define* one -- at least, what makes a great tester in my personal opinion.  I have learned that the software testing world has a huge array of people in it, with an incredibly large spectrum of skill sets.<br /><br />One thing I have learned is that some of the best testers I have met didn't start out in the software industry at all!  Though I did, it has been eye-opening to see people who have come from all kinds of backgrounds.  Chris McMahon, for example, was a musician -- and from what I have gathered, a darn good one!  I once worked with a tester who had a PhD in Material Science and Engineering -- she studied polymer surfaces (if I remember correctly).  Her first software testing job was on a UI-less natural language program (a daunting task for any tester!).<br /><br />people who are naturally curious and take the initiative to learn<br /><br />people who will do things they enjoy<br /><br />hiring for mindset.....<br /><br />hiring for potential...<br /><br />testers come from many backgrounds...<br /><br />risks -- software devs, ppl just taking jobs because they think it's easy, etc<br /><br /></div>
