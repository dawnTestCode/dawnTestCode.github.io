Once in a while, I think we all find some statement we read somewhere, while doing something, that sticks with us.  I have *definitely* found that to be true very recently, mostly because it puts into words a concept that has rolled around in my head for quite some time.<br /><br />First, some background .... If you read my blog, then you know that I have been known to rant, at times.  Really, I try not to, but it happens.  Sometimes, it is just that I want *so badly* for others to change, and I have a hard time understanding why people don't just *do* things the best way, all the time.  Often, when I find others to talk through the issues I am encountering, they ask me questions like "Why do you still work for that place! It's hopeless!"  (Sometimes, I believe it is, and I leave, as I did in 2008.)<br /><br />Sometimes, however, I stick around for a while, and I have a hard time explaining why.  And then, recently, I saw a sentence that resonated with me.<br /><br />Twitter was all abuzz recently with responses to Joel Spolsky's recent blog about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html">"The Duct Tape Programmer"</a>.  He quotes Jamie Zawinski, and Elisabeth Hendrickson (@testobsessed) pulled out Zawinski's <a href="http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nomo.html">resignation letter from AOL</a>.<br /><br />This one quote resonated with me, and continued bouncing around in my head:<br />"...you can divide our industry into two kinds of people: those who want to go work for a company to make it successful, and those who want to go work for a successful company."<br /><br />It rolled around in my head for a few days .... Did I agree? Did I think that people could generally be so easily divided up into just those 2 groups?  Probably not quite *that* easily, but for many people that I have encountered in my career, I could place most of them into one of those pretty quickly.<br /><br />For a while, I have described these groups in the following way: people either seem to come to work because it's a job, and they do their job, and that's it, OR they seem to be really passionate about *what* they do, and are constantly striving to make things better.  I fall into the latter of those 2 categories.  I most certainly do what I love and love what I do.<br /><br />But Jamie's sentence looked at things from just a slightly different point of view, and after thinking about it for a bit, I believe, describes *me* just a little bit better.  I have *always* wanted to work to make things great, and not so much wanted to work for/with/on things that were *already* great.<br /><br />This can be applied to many aspects of my life.  I was the single mom who put herself through college, working full-time and taking full-time classes in CompSci.  I am the vocal advocate of a high functioning autistic child who wrote to the local newspapers when the school district was failing at its job.  I chose to bring a Siberian Husky into my home (this sounds silly, but Husky owners will tell you .... WOW).<br /><br />I THRIVE ON THE CHALLENGE.<br /><br />That's it, that's me.  That's why I like testing over development.  I have said for years that developers have to find one way to solve a problem and testers have to find ALL ways to un-solve the problem.  Testing gives me the challenge of being creative, being technical, being analytical, speaking in at least 2 different languages, juggling an obscene number of balls in the air and being squeezed and sometimes disrespected along the way.  But, it's a challenge, and I like a challenge.<br /><br />In the same way, companies that are struggling, companies that don't "get it", and have fallen into the proven patterns that destroy great ideas, are a CHALLENGE.  They are high-risk, for sure, and sometimes they offer little reward other than knowing I am doing my best, but *if* I can affect change, *if* I can help, the reward is incredible.<br /><br />I believe that for "successful" companies (I place "successful" in quotes because this is a relative term .... for me, in this context, it is mostly about doing things the best way possible), I would personally gain little reward because there would not be *enough* of a challenge.<br /><br />I wonder, then ... how many other great testers that I know are like-minded?  Do other people enjoy testing because they enjoy a challenge?  Would they generally choose to work to make a company successful, or choose to work for a successful company?
